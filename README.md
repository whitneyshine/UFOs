## Overview of Project<br>
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.<br><br>

## Results<br>
For this project, I built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. I then created filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will respond to user input, and subsequently placed the table into an HTML file to produce effortless display.  I tailored the webpage using Bootstrap and had the table configured with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with the particulars of their searches.<br><br>

## Summary<br>
After launching the newly designed website, I would like to offer an area of improvement for the new design as well as recommendations for further development.<br>

**Area for Improvement**<br><br>
Working through the filtered searches, it would serve the visitor of the website to be able to filter to their choice rather than have free-form text.  With the case sensitive nature of the filter box(es), the UFO website surfer could miss data they are looking for just based on the premise of a misspelled word or entering the date in the incorrect format.  Adding a Calendar option that launches a calendar to choose from that will populate the correct format in the filtered boxes would be a great functional enhancement.<br>

**Recommendations for Future Enhancement**<br><br>
First, we need to expand the data as well as clean the text of the data.  If we do not have clean data, the end user could question the validity of our data as well as our website.  To do this, we will use [The Blue Book of Grammar](https://www.grammarbook.com/) as our guide to clean up the text in all of our data fields.  Also, each visitor is going to first try to locate UFO sightings from their hometown or current residence.  We have a very limited amount of data which could translate to very limited traffic to the website.<br>

Second, we need to create a "Reset Filter" option.  If we enter multiple fields in our filter search boxes, we should give the user the ability to clear all inputs at one time.  Going back and deleting the inputs take away from the experience on the website - we want to increase and retain traffic, not lose it based on wasted clicks by the user.<br><br>

Finally,  I would like to explore adding a map visualization tab.  Nothing would be more exciting than to see a heat map created from the UFO sightings - are the East Coast of the United States seeing more sightings or could the Midwest of the US have a higher number of reported sightings?  To add that interaction and visualization will add the user experience while on our website and word of mouth about great websites travels quickly throughout social media.<br>

It has been a great pleasure to work on this website and if you have any questions, please do not hesitiate to reach out.
